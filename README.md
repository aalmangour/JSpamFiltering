This project was developed for the purposes of the course 'Artificial Intelligence' of cs department, Athens University of Economics and Business(AUEB), during the Winter semester 2012 - 2013.

#### Contents
* src folder : contains the source code of the project. It consists of three packages : naive_bayes, logistic_regression, feature_selector.

Finally the third package contains the source that is responsible for extracting characteristic features for spam and non-spam messages.
